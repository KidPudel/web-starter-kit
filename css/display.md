Determines the type of box HTML renders (block, inline-block, inline, none, flex, grid)

# Displays
- `block`: Takes up entire width, other elements can be placed only above or below it
- `inline`: Take up minimum amount of space it could, to try to fit the maximum elements in the line
- `inline-block`: the same as `inline`, but we can set width and height properties
- `none`: acts as it disapears
- `flex`: to layout its children as column or row with `flex-direction`

# Defauilts
- `block`: div
- `inline`: p, a, span
- `inline-block`: img
